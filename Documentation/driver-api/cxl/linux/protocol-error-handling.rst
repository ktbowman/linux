CXL Protocol Error Handling
==============================

CXL devices report protocol-layer failures (CXL.cachemem RAS) as PCIe AER
Internal Errors: PCI_ERR_COR_INTERNAL for correctable events and
PCI_ERR_UNC_INTN for uncorrectable events.  The actual fault information
lives in CXL RAS capability registers, not in the PCIe AER status registers.

The kernel routes every CXL Internal Error through a producer/consumer
pipeline shared by all CXL device types: Root Ports, Upstream/Downstream
Switch Ports, Endpoints, and Restricted CXL Devices (RCDs).


Architecture
============

Two error planes run side by side:

* The **PCIe AER plane** handles native PCIe errors (receiver overflows,
  malformed TLPs, completion timeouts, etc.).
* The **CXL protocol error plane** handles CXL Internal Errors.  The AER
  core forwards them to cxl_core via a dedicated kfifo; cxl_core reads the
  CXL RAS registers, emits trace events, and applies recovery/panic policy.

The boundary between the two planes is enforced by is_cxl_error() in
aer_cxl_vh.c.  It checks info->is_cxl, the PCIe device type (Endpoint,
Root Port, Upstream, or Downstream), and whether the AER status word
indicates an internal error.  RC_END devices are excluded from
is_cxl_error() because they reach the kfifo via the separate
cxl_rch_handle_error() path instead.

The pipeline:

1. **Producer** (aer_cxl_vh.c, aer_cxl_rch.c) - AER threaded handler
   context.  Classifies and enqueues a struct cxl_proto_err_work_data
   into the kfifo.
2. **Queue** - the AER-CXL kfifo plus a backing work_struct.
3. **Consumer** (cxl_core/ras.c) - workqueue context.  Resolves the CXL
   port topology and dispatches to CE/UE handlers.


Topologies
==========

Virtual Hierarchy (VH)
----------------------

Standard PCIe topology: Root Port, optional switch (Upstream Port with one
or more Downstream Ports), and Endpoints.  Each component raises Internal
Errors directly via the Root Port's AER interrupt.

Producer: cxl_forward_error() in aer_cxl_vh.c.

Restricted CXL Host (RCH)
--------------------------

A Root Complex Event Collector (RCEC) aggregates errors from RCDs attached
as Root Complex Integrated Endpoints.  The AER driver iterates RCDs beneath
the RCEC via pcie_walk_rcec() and forwards each qualifying device through
cxl_forward_error() into the same kfifo.

Producer: cxl_forward_error() in aer_cxl_vh.c, called from
cxl_rch_handle_error_iter() via pcie_walk_rcec().

   +-----------------+  +--------------------+

cxl_do_recovery() first checks whether the CXL RAS register block is
mapped.  If it is not (to_ras_base() returns NULL), the kernel panics
immediately without reading any register or emitting a trace event,
because a signaled UCE cannot be confirmed or cleared.  Otherwise it
reads the CXL RAS uncorrectable status register.  If UE bits are set, it
emits the trace event and panics.  If no bits are set (e.g. RAS mapped but
error already cleared), it logs a debug diagnostic and defers to AER
recovery.


Severity policy
===============

**CE** - cxl_handle_cor_ras() reads the CXL RAS correctable status register,
clears set bits, and emits a cxl_aer_correctable_error trace event.  No
recovery action.

**UCE (non-fatal, and fatal on Root Port/Downstream Port)** -
cxl_do_recovery() reads the CXL RAS uncorrectable status register.  If UE
bits are set, the kernel panics.  If the CXL RAS register block is not
mapped (to_ras_base() returns NULL), cxl_do_recovery() panics before any
register read and emits no trace event, since the UCE cannot be confirmed.
CXL.cachemem traffic cannot be safely recovered once an uncorrectable error
is signaled; continuing risks silent data corruption.  This panic policy
applies to the native AER path.  On firmware-first (CPER/GHES) platforms the
CPER handler emits trace events only and does not call cxl_do_recovery().

**Fatal UCE on EP/USP** - The AER core driver does not read AER status
registers for Endpoint and Upstream Ports with fatal events because the
link is down.  Without AER status, is_cxl_error() cannot classify the
event as a CXL protocol error, so it does not enter the kfifo path.  For
Endpoints, the pci_error_handlers .error_detected callback
(cxl_pci_error_detected()) handles the event directly.  For restricted
devices (is_cxl_restricted(), i.e. RCD/RC_END) it first calls
cxl_handle_rdport_errors() to process the RCH Downstream Port RAS, then
reads the Endpoint's CXL RAS registers and panics on UCE.  The RAS read is
unconditional regardless of channel state: on a dead link readl() returns
0xFFFFFFFF, which sets all UCE bits and intentionally triggers the same
panic, since CXL.mem coherency is already lost.  If the RAS registers are
not mapped the read is skipped and the frozen/perm_failure channel states
are handled as standard AER recovery.  For Upstream Ports bound to portdrv,
the error is handled as a standard AER event - this is a known limitation.


RCH special case
================

When the consumer sees is_cxl_restricted(pdev), it calls
cxl_handle_rdport_errors() first to process the RCH Downstream Port's RAS
registers (accessed via RCRB, not standard config space).  It then
continues to process the RCD Endpoint's own RAS registers via the common
path.  Both register blocks are checked because errors can appear in either
independently.

cxl_handle_rdport_errors() acquires the port lock internally.  Callers must
not hold it.


Trace events
============

Two trace events cover all device types and both the native AER and
CPER/GHES firmware-first paths:

* cxl_aer_correctable_error
* cxl_aer_uncorrectable_error

Fields:

* ``memdev`` - memdev name for Endpoints; empty for non-Endpoints.
* ``port`` - CXL port device name.
* ``dport`` - Downstream Port device name; empty when not applicable.
* ``host`` - parent host bridge or uport device name.
* ``serial`` - PCI Device Serial Number from pdev->dsn (cached at
  enumeration; no config-space read in the error path).


Interrupt masking
=================

CXL Internal Error bits (PCI_ERR_UNC_INTN and PCI_ERR_COR_INTERNAL) are
unmasked in the AER capability only after the CXL RAS register block is
successfully mapped.  A devm teardown action restores the mask when the
port or dport is removed, ensuring clean state after driver removal.
